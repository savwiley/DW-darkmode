# DreamWidth Dark Mode Site Skin

A low contrast, dark site skin for [DreamWidth](https://www.dreamwidth.org/). Being made with [Stylus](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus). Very much a work in progress.

## Want to test drive it and leave feedback?

1. Install Stylus via the link above as a browser extension.
2. Click "Write New Style." Copy/paste the contents of `style.css` into the code editor.
3. Under "Applies to" select "URLs on the domain" and type in "dreamwidth.org" into the field.
4. Save and make sure the "Enabled" checkbox is clicked.
5. Make sure the extension has permission to access DreamWidth.
6. [Leave feedback](https://github.com/savwiley/DW-darkmode/issues) for me in the Issues. Please keep in mind, this whole thing is a big old WIP.
