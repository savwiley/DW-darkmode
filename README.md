<p align="center">A low contrast, dark site skin for <a href="https://www.dreamwidth.org/">Dreamwidth</a>. Made with <a href="https://github.com/openstyles/stylus">Stylus</a>.</p>

## Want to test drive it and leave feedback?

1. Make sure to apply one of the "Tropospherical" site skin default styles under your [display settings](https://www.dreamwidth.org/manage/settings/?cat=display).
2. Install Stylus as a browser extension. Visit the [wiki](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus/wiki) if you have any problems here. [[Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne)] [[Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/)] [[Opera](https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/stylus/)] (Alternatively, you can use any other program that lets you add custom skins to a site.)
3. Once it's installed and you have the extension open, click "Write New Style." Copy/paste the contents of `style.css` into the code editor. [Here is the raw code.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/savwiley/DW-darkmode/main/style.css)
4. Save and make sure the "Enabled" checkbox is clicked.
5. Spot something wrong? [Leave feedback](https://github.com/savwiley/DW-darkmode/issues) for me in the Issues.

## Troubleshooting

- Is nothing changing? Make sure the extension has full access to change any site in your browser.
- This skin is compatable with [Dreamwidth for Widescreen](https://userstyles.org/styles/30671/dreamwidth-for-widescreen) but you have to edit a portion of the code. Ctrl+F for `#page` around line 56 & remove `left: 5%; right: 5%;`. If this doesn't work for you, let me know!
- If you have other skins installed, this one may not work unless you turn those off. However, if you let me know about any conflicts going on, I can try to make it compatible with those as well.

## Notes

- Custom styling on journal entries cannot be changed.
- Every icon is not customized, such as ones that are business logos (OpenID, Plurk, etc).
