# Dreamwidth Dark Mode Site Skin

A low contrast, dark site skin for [Dreamwidth](https://www.dreamwidth.org/). Made with [Stylus](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus).

## Want to test drive it and leave feedback?

1. Install Stylus as a browser extension. Visit the [wiki](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus/wiki) if you have any problems here. [[Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne)] [[Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/)] [[Opera](https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/stylus/)] (Alternatively, you can use any other program that lets you add custom skins to a site.)
2. Once it's installed and you have the extension open, click "Write New Style." Copy/paste the contents of `style.css` into the code editor. [Here is the raw code.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/savwiley/DW-darkmode/main/style.css)
3. Save and make sure the "Enabled" checkbox is clicked.
4. Spot something wrong? [Leave feedback](https://github.com/savwiley/DW-darkmode/issues) for me in the Issues.

## Troubleshooting

- Is nothing changing? Make sure the extension has full access to change any site in your browser.

## Notes

- Custom styling on journal entries cannot be changed.
